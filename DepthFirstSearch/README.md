# Depth First Search (Dijkstra's Implementation)
The purpose of this project is to show how to handle graph data structures. I implemented depth-first search for identifying the connected components of an undirected graph, implementing procedure Search as a subroutine along the way. I used the NetworkX Python package to represent and manipulate graphs. I used Homer's Iliad to create my Graph nodes and edges.
